## object oriented programming

all codes from my third semester in uni.
we primarily used Java and learned Object Oriented Programming. 

the directory titled "PROJECT+GUIEVERYTHING" contains the directories for my platformer game, and its different versions,
along with directories titled "TUTGUI#" where i stored and commented on GUI code as i learned Java's Swing framework for creating my game.

this is meant to be a backup of my raw code from uni, so the comments may include profanity and strong language. discretion is advised.
