so, use "psvm" and then tab, to generate public static void main string args automatically

similarly, "sout", and syso and tab generates System.out.println

remember, public class must start with a Capital letter, and match the name of the file (case sensitive)

if you're gonna take a full string input using sc.nextLine, after maybe taking a number as an input, remember to clear the input buffer.
you do this by putting in sc.nextLine one time before actually taking the input.
so, nextLine takes input until the return button is hit, since you hit it after entering a number, it stops operation.
now, putting in an extra sc.nextLine compensates for the return hit and then takes the string until return is hit again properly,
the way it's supposed to.

CLI TIPS:
ls: to list current directories (where you're at)
cd: to make your current directory that folder (or to enter the folder, "cd LAB1")
javac: to compile your class (basically "javac L1T2.java")
java: to run it, just type in java and just the name of the file (no extension, so "java L1T2")


/*reference class -> */ Animal /*actual class -> */ pig = new Animal();

additional,
cp: copy a file
mkdir: make a new directory (folder)
mv: ***IMP*** move or rename sth (so to rename, for example a file named "wow" to "wow.java", you'd enter: "mv wow wow.java")
rm: remove or delete files 
rmdir: remove directory (folder)
